  This project is intended to do ECG arrhythmia classification using a 2-D convolutional neural network in which we classify ECG into seven categories, one being normal and the other six being different types of arrhythmia using deep two-dimensional CNN with grayscale ECG images. By transforming one-dimensional ECG signals into two-dimensional ECG images, noise filtering and feature extraction are no longer required. This is important since some of ECG beats are ignored in noise filtering and feature extraction. In addition, training data can be enlarged by augmenting the ECG images using cropping techniques which results in higher classification accuracy.However, augmenting two-dimensional ECG images with different cropping methods helps the CNN model to train with different viewpoints of the single ECG images. Data augmentation is hard to be applied in 1-d signals since the distortion of 1-d ECG signal could downgrade the performance of the classifier and sometimes distort the rarely occuring ecg signals.
